            <h1 style="text-align:center;"><cite>My Hometown</cite></h2>
            <p>Since from my birth, I have been living in Dhaka with my family. In our family we are four members and I'm the elder son of my parents. But permanently our hometown is in <cite style="color:green;"> Barguna</cite> district which is situated in the <cite style="color:green;">South</cite> part of Bangladesh and bounded by the <q><cite>Jhalkathi, Barisal, Pirojpur and Patuakhali</cite></q> districts on Northern part. On the south, Barguna is bounded by the <cite>Patuakhali</cite> district, and the <cite> Bay of Bengal</cite>.There are some important rivers that flows from the heart of barguna distrit and they are- </p>

			<p>In my leisure time most often I love to solve code problems but if I keep my passion in a side then I will say I love to read non-textual books like <cite> Detective stories,Novels,Fictions</cite> and many others of famous and unknown writters in my leisure. Again sometimes I love to write stories,poem or doing a sketch of any picture or photo to keep my mind fresh when I find chaos around me. So this blamming maybe quite true from my close friends that I have some weired hobbies according to my future carrier. <img src="smile.jpg"></p> 
            <h3 style="text-align:center;"><cite>My Favourite Things That I love To Do</cite></h3>
            <p>From my childhood I am a sport freak. So it is beyond saying that I love to play. But if i need to give priority then I will say that I love to play outdoor games rather than the indoor. I love both playing cricket and football.In cricket apart of Team Bangladesh, I am a big fan of South Africa and AB Develliers.In football my favourite team is Argentina and in this team I love some the players like <cite>Kun Aguero, Lionel Andres Messi,Dybala,Pavon,Sergeo Romero,Mascherano,Lavezzi</cite> and so on.And in club football I support Barcelona and Manchester city. Again I love to watch thriller and action movies. I am a big fan of <cite>Detective series</cite> like <cite>Sherlock Holmes and Feluda</cite> and Marvel movie. My favourite quote is from <cite>The Former President Of America Abraham Lincon</cite> and it is <a href="http://www.wisdomtoinspire.com/t/abraham-lincoln/N1j6Acud/i-walk-slowly-but-i-never-walk-backward" target="_blank"><em><q style="color:blue">I walk slowly but I never walk backward.</q></em></a></p>
